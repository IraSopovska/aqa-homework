How to generate different set of SSH keys ?

Different set of SSH keys can be generated for different Githubs accounts on the same computer.

We should follow the next steps:

1. Check for SSH keys - $ ls -al ~/.ssh 
2. Set up another ssh key - ssh-keygen-t rsa - b 4096- C "email" 
3. If we already have a key, and want to make new key, then we use a different name for this key ( for example the previous key name:/.ssh/id_rsa ; the new one: /.ssh/work_rsa) and leave the password blank
4. The new key is generated. And we check if the new SSH key is displayed among the list by typing ls -al ~/.ssh command in the terminal.
5. Enter clip < ~/.ssh/work_rsa.pub command in order to copy the SSH key for the GIThub account.
6. Go to GitHub account- Settings- SSH ans GPG keys and Press button "Add New".  
7. Modify the ssh config file ( ~/.ssh/config) We are adjusting multiple ssh keys - by default the id_rsa.pub file is always used, we have to tell ssh to look different public key file depending on the service.
   We prescribe which account, host, hostname, user are intended to which identity file.
8. Then we clone our repo (git clone) and modify git config
